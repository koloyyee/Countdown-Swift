#  Requirements for Countdown App

Users enter a name for their countdown timer (e.g. “My Wedding”) and enter a date and time for when the event will take place. Afterwards, users can view the countdown screen for an event, showing how many days and hours are left.

The UI should include:

A countdown screen with a timer for the selected event
A button to add a new countdown event
A list of all active countdown events
For an extra challenge:

Allow users to view archives of past events
Automatically trigger push notification reminders x days before each event
Allow users to customise the look and feel of each event (i.e. choose a color scheme, add an emoji, or upload custom background images)
Create an iOS or Android widget to show countdown timers on the user’s home screen
